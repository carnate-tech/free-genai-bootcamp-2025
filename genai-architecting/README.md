## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure.
The reason is because there is a concern about the privacy of user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatly raise in cost.

They want to invest in AI PC where they can afford to spend 10-15k.
They have 300 students, and students are located within the city of Santa Rosa.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the open-source LLMs that we choose will be poerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15k.

We're just going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet and we should have enough bandwidth to serve the 300 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We're considering using IBM Granite because it is a truly open-source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we are able to know what is going on with our model.
